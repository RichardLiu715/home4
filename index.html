			<h2> What is anime? </h2>	
			<p> Anime is a japanese animated cartoon, animated film, or television entertainment. It is a Japanese term for hand-drawn or computer animation. The word comes from the pronunciation of "animation".</p>

			<h2 id="history"> History </h2>
	
			<p> The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917 and was called  “Katsudō Shashin”. Japanese anime production has since continued to increase steadily. The anime art style first emerged in the 1960s with the works of Osamu Tezuka and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large international audience, and gaining a lot of popularity. </p>

			<h2 id="global"> Globaliation </h2>
			<p> Anime was first introduced into America in 1951. Osamu Tezuka created the milestone manga called Astro Boy, as it was known in the US. As a result, years later he became a pioneer in anime, and was the man responsible for the success of anime and manga worldwide. </p>

			<h2 id="process"> The Process of Making an anime</h2>
		<p>The process of making an anime is a complex one, with many steps and stages. One anime episode (20 mins) usually takes about a week to make even with more than 300 people. It costs at least 50000 dollars per episode. </p>
		<p> The first step is to write the episode scripts. Following the plans, the full scripts are written, by either one person for the whole series or by several different writers. The episode director takes the plan and must plan out how it will actually look on screen. The storyboard is then created by the director</p>

		<p>After the storyboard is approved by the director, they are then duplicated and given to the background department, and the key animators. The art director and assistants work on painting the background artwork based on the rough drawings. Now all that's left is the animation!</p>
			<img src="drawings.jpg" width="200" length="200" alt= "rough drawings">
		<p>Based on the storyboard, the key animators start working, creating the animation drawings. They first draw the most important scenes and poses. After, the in between animators draw the in between animations, so the scene runs smoother.  After it's checked by the director, the color and shading starts. </p>

		<p>Once this step is finished, It gets handed over to the special effects studio, where they implement effects such as glowing, CGI, and many more. Finally, they record the voices of voice actors, and dub the episode. Now, the episode is complete. It just needs to find a sponsor, so they can officially release the episode into the public. (There are many more steps this. This was a simplified version.)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Imovk-s40I"> A video on how anime is made </a></p>
