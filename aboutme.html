		<h1 id="top2">About me: Richard Liu</h1>
		<p> Hi. My name is Richard Liu, I'm 14 years old, my birthday is July 15, and I was born in China. I came to Vancouver when I was 2 years old, and ever since, I stayed in Canada with the occasional visits to China.</p>

		<h2> My Interests </h2>
		<p> My favourite subject in school is probably gym class. I have always been very athletic, and I go out with my family almost every day to run a kilometer or two. My favourite sport is Badminton. Mainly because I'm good at it. Other sports I like are: Ultamite frisbee, swimming, skiing, tennis, handball, and running. I hate soccer, basketball, and volleyball beacuse I'm horrible at them. I've never played rugby before, and it sounds fun, so maybe I will consider joining the team this year or next year. </p>

		<p> I hate Language and geo classes because they are so boring. And I can't even get good marks in language! </p>
		<p> I don't have a favourite food. Anything would taste good it it were made by a skilled chef. However, I prefer eating pizza, sushi, and pretty much anything that has meat inside. </p>

		<h2> Hobbies </h2>
		<p> Usually, when im bored, I would draw something (probably an anime character), or I would go on youtube and watch something. As you can probably tell, my main hobby is watching anime. In fact, I watch so much anime, I think I ran out of animes to watch! Now I just read webtoons, or manga. If you're interested in anime, then <a href="index.html">Check out my website! </a></p>
